//TODO
// - Need to find a more suitable avatar or find a pic to replace it
// - split CSS into individual files for each component
// - Fix the social media icons in Home About, slightly off-centre
// - maybe change the icons throughout? especially for navbar. check react-icons
//   to see what they have
// - NavBar still giving some trouble. Issue is mainly with the flex direction of the
//   links and trying to make them switch from row to column based on the width of the
//   window. Want them to be column when the window is small and we have those three
//   lines basically. Will have to dig into the documentation for Nav.Toggle and figure
//   out how he made that three line span functionality work
// - Need to add projects to the projects page
